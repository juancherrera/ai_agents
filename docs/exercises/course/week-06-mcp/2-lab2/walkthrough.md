# Expose account tools and read resources

Source: [6_mcp/2_lab2.ipynb](../../../../../6_mcp/2_lab2.ipynb). Practice: [commented notebook](practice.ipynb).

Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Inspect Account → perform simulated operation → expose server → list tools → adapt client tools → read account resource → design a date tool.

**Before source execution:** Source account imports can initialize accounts.db, and buying changes stored simulation state. Practice never imports these modules; it uses dictionaries and an in-process harmless server.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Simulated accounts change state

Buying shares updates cash, holdings, and a transaction record. Practice against a dictionary so you do not import account modules that create or alter databases.

**Ask yourself:** How much cash remains after buying three fictional shares at 100 each?

**Practice:** Try an unaffordable order and confirm the balance is unchanged. Explain why reset is a data-changing action.

### MCP tools, resources, and server lifetime

A tool performs an operation; a resource supplies readable context. A client discovers tool descriptions and calls them while the server is connected. This fixture is not a protocol transport.

**Ask yourself:** Is listing tool names the same as executing them?

**Practice:** Add a read-only dictionary resource and a tool returning a fixed date. Explain how discovery differs from invocation.

### Register a real local FastMCP tool without starting a server

The decorator registers a Python function with FastMCP. Tool listing here happens directly in process; it neither launches a subprocess nor calls a hosted model.

**Ask yourself:** Which tool name will be discovered?

**Practice:** Register a second harmless function. To expose stdio later, use a separate script with server.run(transport="stdio"); stdout then carries protocol messages.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

## Follow the source in order

### Cell 1: Week 6, Day 2

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 2: code

- Make available: `dotenv`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `agents`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `agents.mcp`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `IPython.display`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- `load_dotenv`: Load configuration into the process; use the explicit repository .environment/.env path in your practice copy.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 3: code

- Make available: `accounts`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

### Cell 4: code

- Store expression result in `account`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.

### Cell 9: code

- Store dictionary in `params`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Keep a resource open for the block, then clean it up. Server/tool calls must remain inside the connection lifetime.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
