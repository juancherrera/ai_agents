# filesystem test

Source: [6_mcp/community_contributions/BDD/filesystem_test.ipynb](../../../../../../../6_mcp/community_contributions/BDD/filesystem_test.ipynb). Practice: [commented notebook](practice.ipynb).

Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Await vs. concurrent work → MCP tools, resources, and server lifetime

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### MCP tools, resources, and server lifetime

A tool performs an operation; a resource supplies readable context. A client discovers tool descriptions and calls them while the server is connected. This fixture is not a protocol transport.

**Ask yourself:** Is listing tool names the same as executing them?

**Practice:** Add a read-only dictionary resource and a tool returning a fixed date. Explain how discovery differs from invocation.

## Follow the source in order

### Cell 1: code

- Make available: `asyncio`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `os`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `json`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `mcp`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `mcp.client.stdio`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 2: code

- Define `test_filesystem_server()`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `session.list_tools`: Discover tool descriptions. Discovery does not invoke their functions.
- `session.call_tool`: Invoke a tool with named arguments while its session is connected.
- `json.loads`: Decode JSON text to Python data; invalid JSON raises an exception.
- `json.dumps`: Convert Python data to JSON text.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 3: code

- Inspect the evaluated value or expression; displaying it does not necessarily modify state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 4: code

Empty code cell; it defines no state.

## Definitions to find

| Cell | Name | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | `test_filesystem_server` | async function |

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
