# abdoul: project walkthrough

Practice: [commented offline exercises](practice.ipynb).

This module/project pack is extracted from the local files listed below. Functions and line numbers are source locations; the original program is not executed by practice.

## Read the project in this order

1. README and dependency manifest: intended setup and command.
2. Entry point (`main.py`, `app.py`, or the documented launcher): starting input.
3. Worker/crew/graph definitions: who handles it and what state is passed.
4. Tool/server definitions: where external operations begin.
5. Output/storage and cleanup: what changes and when execution stops.

## Concepts to understand

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### Parameterized SQL and isolated data

SQLite stores records. Parameterized values keep data separate from SQL syntax. We use :memory: so the exercise neither deletes nor changes the source databases.

**Ask yourself:** What happens when you query a city that is not present?

**Practice:** Insert another fictional city and query it. Explain why source code deleting tickets.db should not run just to inspect an import.

### MCP tools, resources, and server lifetime

A tool performs an operation; a resource supplies readable context. A client discovers tool descriptions and calls them while the server is connected. This fixture is not a protocol transport.

**Ask yourself:** Is listing tool names the same as executing them?

**Practice:** Add a read-only dictionary resource and a tool returning a fixed date. Explain how discovery differs from invocation.

### Register a real local FastMCP tool without starting a server

The decorator registers a Python function with FastMCP. Tool listing here happens directly in process; it neither launches a subprocess nor calls a hosted model.

**Ask yourself:** Which tool name will be discovered?

**Practice:** Register a second harmless function. To expose stdio later, use a separate script with server.run(transport="stdio"); stdout then carries protocol messages.

## Module-by-module reading map

### [6_mcp/community_contributions/abdoul/research_server.py](../../../../../../6_mcp/community_contributions/abdoul/research_server.py)

**Imports:**

- `datetime` — Local or third-party dependency; follow its definition/import before execution.
- `json` — Encoding/decoding structured text.
- `mcp.server.fastmcp` — Tool/resource protocol, clients, and servers.
- `sqlite3` — Local database storage.

| Source line | Definition | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | `get_db` | function |
| 42 | `save_company` | async function |
| 54 | `save_research` | async function |
| 66 | `save_thesis` | async function |
| 78 | `read_company_resource` | async function |
| 112 | `read_all_companies_resource` | async function |

**Read in this order:**

- Make available: `mcp.server.fastmcp`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `sqlite3`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `json`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `datetime`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Store expression result in `mcp`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Define `get_db()`. Its body runs when called.
- Define `save_company(symbol, name, sector)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Define `save_research(symbol, content)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Define `save_thesis(symbol, thesis)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Define `read_company_resource(symbol)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Define `read_all_companies_resource()`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Choose a branch using a condition. Predict both the true and false paths before running the source.
- `FastMCP`: Create a tool/resource server; registration and serving are separate steps.
- `mcp.tool`: Register a function as a tool using a decorator or wrapper.
- `sqlite3.connect`: Open a database or network/server connection; identify the receiver.
- `cursor.execute`: Execute an operation such as SQL; inspect the statement and its effect.
- `conn.commit`: Persist pending database changes or another transaction.
- `conn.close`: Release the resource; match setup with cleanup.
- `json.dumps`: Convert Python data to JSON text.
- `mcp.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.

**Exercise:** choose one defined function. Trace its arguments → local calculations → return value. Mark any network call, file/database write, generated-code execution, or runtime start separately. Recreate the calculation using fictional inputs before connecting its dependencies.

## Configuration boundary

Use [.environment/.env configuration](../../../../configuration.md). The practice code uses no credentials. The source may initialize files/databases during import; source launchers are not import tests. Original provider/transport behavior is UNVERIFIED at runtime.
