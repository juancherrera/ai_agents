# weather agent: project walkthrough

Practice: [commented offline exercises](practice.ipynb).

This module/project pack is extracted from the local files listed below. Functions and line numbers are source locations; the original program is not executed by practice.

## Read the project in this order

1. README and dependency manifest: intended setup and command.
2. Entry point (`main.py`, `app.py`, or the documented launcher): starting input.
3. Worker/crew/graph definitions: who handles it and what state is passed.
4. Tool/server definitions: where external operations begin.
5. Output/storage and cleanup: what changes and when execution stops.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### Structured output validates shape

Pydantic models name the fields you expect and check constraints. This helps callers use results reliably, but a valid field can still contain a false claim.

**Ask yourself:** Will confidence=2 pass the constraint?

**Practice:** Add a field named follow_up_questions with type list[str]. Construct a valid object using it.

### MCP tools, resources, and server lifetime

A tool performs an operation; a resource supplies readable context. A client discovers tool descriptions and calls them while the server is connected. This fixture is not a protocol transport.

**Ask yourself:** Is listing tool names the same as executing them?

**Practice:** Add a read-only dictionary resource and a tool returning a fixed date. Explain how discovery differs from invocation.

### Register a real local FastMCP tool without starting a server

The decorator registers a Python function with FastMCP. Tool listing here happens directly in process; it neither launches a subprocess nor calls a hosted model.

**Ask yourself:** Which tool name will be discovered?

**Practice:** Register a second harmless function. To expose stdio later, use a separate script with server.run(transport="stdio"); stdout then carries protocol messages.

### Simulated accounts change state

Buying shares updates cash, holdings, and a transaction record. Practice against a dictionary so you do not import account modules that create or alter databases.

**Ask yourself:** How much cash remains after buying three fictional shares at 100 each?

**Practice:** Try an unaffordable order and confirm the balance is unchanged. Explain why reset is a data-changing action.

### Request, status, and parsed body

An HTTP client sends a request and returns a status plus response body. Provider requests are network side effects; a fixture lets you practice handling success/failure without sending one.

**Ask yourself:** Will a non-200 response be treated as success here?

**Practice:** Add a 429 fixture and distinguish rate limiting from authentication. Explain why real calls need timeouts.

## Module-by-module reading map

### [6_mcp/community_contributions/weather_agent/weather.py](../../../../../../6_mcp/community_contributions/weather_agent/weather.py)

**Imports:**

- `dotenv` — Load explicit environment-file configuration.
- `os` — Process configuration and operating-system paths.
- `pydantic` — Validated structured objects.
- `requests` — Synchronous HTTP requests.

| Source line | Definition | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | `fetch_weather_by_city` | function |
| 17 | `Weather` | class |
| 20 | `get_temperature_by_city` | function |
| 27 | `get_weather_by_city` | function |
| 34 | `get_humidity_by_city` | function |
| 41 | `get_wind_by_city` | function |

**Read in this order:**

- Make available: `pydantic`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `requests`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `os`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `dotenv`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Store expression result in `API_KEY`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Define `fetch_weather_by_city(city)`. Its body runs when called.
- Define class `Weather` using `BaseModel`. Separate the class definition, constructing an instance, and calling its methods.
- `load_dotenv`: Load configuration into the process; use the explicit repository .environment/.env path in your practice copy.
- `os.getenv`: Read a named environment setting; check presence rather than printing its value.
- `requests.get`: Retrieve a value or HTTP resource, depending on the receiver.

**Exercise:** choose one defined function. Trace its arguments → local calculations → return value. Mark any network call, file/database write, generated-code execution, or runtime start separately. Recreate the calculation using fictional inputs before connecting its dependencies.

### [6_mcp/community_contributions/weather_agent/weather_server.py](../../../../../../6_mcp/community_contributions/weather_agent/weather_server.py)

**Imports:**

- `mcp.server.fastmcp` — Tool/resource protocol, clients, and servers.
- `weather` — Local or third-party dependency; follow its definition/import before execution.

| Source line | Definition | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | `get_city_temperature` | async function |
| 20 | `get_city_weather` | async function |
| 33 | `get_city_humidity` | async function |
| 47 | `get_city_wind` | async function |

**Read in this order:**

- Make available: `mcp.server.fastmcp`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `weather`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Store expression result in `mcp`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Define `get_city_temperature(city)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Define `get_city_weather(city)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Define `get_city_humidity(city)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Define `get_city_wind(city)`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Choose a branch using a condition. Predict both the true and false paths before running the source.
- `FastMCP`: Create a tool/resource server; registration and serving are separate steps.
- `mcp.tool`: Register a function as a tool using a decorator or wrapper.
- `mcp.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.

**Exercise:** choose one defined function. Trace its arguments → local calculations → return value. Mark any network call, file/database write, generated-code execution, or runtime start separately. Recreate the calculation using fictional inputs before connecting its dependencies.

## Configuration boundary

Use [.environment/.env configuration](../../../../configuration.md). The practice code uses no credentials. The source may initialize files/databases during import; source launchers are not import tests. Original provider/transport behavior is UNVERIFIED at runtime.
