Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → Configure a real SDK agent and inspect its tool schema → Client, request, and response are separate objects → Await vs. concurrent work → Browser tools have setup, action, and cleanup → MCP tools, resources, and server lifetime

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Configure a real SDK agent and inspect its tool schema

Agent holds instructions/model/tools. The function_tool decorator constructs a schema from the signature and docstring. Constructing this configuration does not run the agent or contact a provider.

**Ask yourself:** Which argument names will appear in the registered tool schema?

**Practice:** Change the docstring and inspect the tool description. Find Runner.run in the source: that is where the interaction loop actually begins.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### Browser tools have setup, action, and cleanup

A browser toolkit makes actions such as navigation and extraction callable. The practice object imitates that lifetime with fixed HTML; it launches no browser and accesses no website.

**Ask yourself:** Can extraction happen before navigation in this demonstration?

**Practice:** Call extract before navigate and inspect the error. Explain why real Playwright also needs binaries and cleanup.

### MCP tools, resources, and server lifetime

A tool performs an operation; a resource supplies readable context. A client discovers tool descriptions and calls them while the server is connected. This fixture is not a protocol transport.

**Ask yourself:** Is listing tool names the same as executing them?

**Practice:** Add a read-only dictionary resource and a tool returning a fixed date. Explain how discovery differs from invocation.

## Follow the source in order

### Cell 1: Agent logging with lifecycle hooks

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 2: code

- Make available: `dotenv`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `agents`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `agents_logging`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `mcp_server_manager`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `os`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 3: code

- `load_dotenv`: Load configuration into the process; use the explicit repository .environment/.env path in your practice copy.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 4: code

- Store expression result in `sandbox_path`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `brave_api_key`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store dictionary in `server_configs`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `instructions`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `input`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Keep a resource open for the block, then clean it up. Server/tool calls must remain inside the connection lifetime.
- `os.getenv`: Read a named environment setting; check presence rather than printing its value.
- `Agent`: Define an agent configuration: responsibilities, model, and available tools.
- `trace`: Group activity for inspection. Configured tracing may export run data.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `Runner.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 5: Check out the trace

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 6: blank separator

No execution needed.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
