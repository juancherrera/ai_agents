# 2 lab2 mcp work around: project walkthrough

Practice: [commented offline exercises](practice.ipynb).

This module/project pack is extracted from the local files listed below. Functions and line numbers are source locations; the original program is not executed by practice.

## Read the project in this order

1. README and dependency manifest: intended setup and command.
2. Entry point (`main.py`, `app.py`, or the documented launcher): starting input.
3. Worker/crew/graph definitions: who handles it and what state is passed.
4. Tool/server definitions: where external operations begin.
5. Output/storage and cleanup: what changes and when execution stops.

## Concepts to understand

### Messages: instructions, earlier turns, and the new question

The model request is a list of messages. A role says who is speaking; content holds the text. The system instruction and prior conversation serve different purposes.

**Ask yourself:** How many messages are sent on the follow-up turn?

**Practice:** Set history to an empty list. Explain what is lost while the system instruction remains.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

## Configuration and supporting files

- [5_autogen/community_contributions/2_lab2_mcp_work_around/readme.md](../../../../../../5_autogen/community_contributions/2_lab2_mcp_work_around/readme.md): ✅ Workaround for MCP in Autogen Lab 2 on Windows. Read local setup/run instructions before invoking the entry point; remote linked material is unverified.

## Module-by-module reading map

**Imports:**

- `asyncio` — Coroutines, scheduling, and concurrency.
- `autogen_agentchat.agents` — Conversational assistants and teams.
- `autogen_ext.models.openai` — Model/tool/runtime integrations for AutoGen.
- `autogen_ext.tools.mcp` — Model/tool/runtime integrations for AutoGen.

| Source line | Definition | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | `main` | async function |

**Read in this order:**

- Make available: `asyncio`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `autogen_agentchat.agents`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `autogen_ext.models.openai`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `autogen_ext.tools.mcp`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Define `main()`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- Choose a branch using a condition. Predict both the true and false paths before running the source.
- `AssistantAgent`: Configure an AutoGen assistant and its model client/tools.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `asyncio.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.
- `agent.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.

**Exercise:** choose one defined function. Trace its arguments → local calculations → return value. Mark any network call, file/database write, generated-code execution, or runtime start separately. Recreate the calculation using fictional inputs before connecting its dependencies.

## Configuration boundary

Use [.environment/.env configuration](../../../../configuration.md). The practice code uses no credentials. The source may initialize files/databases during import; source launchers are not import tests. Original provider/transport behavior is UNVERIFIED at runtime.
