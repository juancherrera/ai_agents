# langgraph checkpoint howto: project walkthrough

Practice: [commented offline exercises](practice.ipynb).

This module/project pack is extracted from the local files listed below. Functions and line numbers are source locations; the original program is not executed by practice.

## Read the project in this order

1. README and dependency manifest: intended setup and command.
2. Entry point (`main.py`, `app.py`, or the documented launcher): starting input.
3. Worker/crew/graph definitions: who handles it and what state is passed.
4. Tool/server definitions: where external operations begin.
5. Output/storage and cleanup: what changes and when execution stops.

## Concepts to understand

### Messages: instructions, earlier turns, and the new question

The model request is a list of messages. A role says who is speaking; content holds the text. The system instruction and prior conversation serve different purposes.

**Ask yourself:** How many messages are sent on the follow-up turn?

**Practice:** Set history to an empty list. Explain what is lost while the system instruction remains.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### An agent loop must make progress and stop

A loop repeats model/tool steps until a final answer or a configured limit. This fixed script of decisions shows the order without executing generated code or calling a model.

**Ask yourself:** Which decision ends the loop?

**Practice:** Add another tool step before the answer. Keep a finite turn limit and explain how the stopping rule changes.

### Plan → search → synthesize

The research workflow separates a search plan, collected findings, and a report. Use fixed fictional snippets first so you can inspect how evidence reaches the writer. No current facts are being researched here.

**Ask yourself:** Will the report receive the original query as well as the findings?

**Practice:** Add a third search plan item and a matching fixture. Explain how the original query keeps synthesis focused.

### Drafting and delivering are separate steps

An agent that formats text is different from a tool that sends email or notifications. This exercise records a delivery intention in memory only.

**Ask yourself:** Will constructing this draft contact anyone?

**Practice:** Format the body as HTML but keep dry_run_send unchanged. Explain where real delivery would begin.

### Reducer vs. checkpoints vs. conversation identity

A reducer combines state updates. A checkpointer retains state across invocations. A thread_id selects a conversation. This uses SQLite in memory, so it creates no database file.

**Ask yourself:** Does a different thread_id share the same list?

**Practice:** Replace :memory: with a deliberately chosen practice database only if you want persistence. Explain when it would survive process exit.

## Configuration and supporting files

- [4_langgraph/community_contributions/langgraph_checkpoint_howto/README.md](../../../../../../4_langgraph/community_contributions/langgraph_checkpoint_howto/README.md): Langgraph - how to retrieve checkpoint_id(s) from the history and re-run the graph. Read local setup/run instructions before invoking the entry point; remote linked material is unverified.

## Reading exercise

This contribution supplies documents/configuration rather than Python modules. Restate its expected inputs and outputs; follow the linked notebook packs for executable examples.

## Configuration boundary

Use [.environment/.env configuration](../../../../configuration.md). The practice code uses no credentials. The source may initialize files/databases during import; source launchers are not import tests. Original provider/transport behavior is UNVERIFIED at runtime.
