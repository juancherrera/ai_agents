Source: [1_foundations/community_contributions/elchanio-76/elchanio_wk1_lab1.ipynb](../../../../../../../1_foundations/community_contributions/elchanio-76/elchanio_wk1_lab1.ipynb). Practice: [commented notebook](practice.ipynb).

Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → Messages

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Messages: instructions, earlier turns, and the new question

The model request is a list of messages. A role says who is speaking; content holds the text. The system instruction and prior conversation serve different purposes.

**Ask yourself:** How many messages are sent on the follow-up turn?

**Practice:** Set history to an empty list. Explain what is lost while the system instruction remains.

## Follow the source in order

### Cell 1: Week 1 - Lab 1: Generate a business idea with Amazon Nova

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 2: code

- Inspect the evaluated value or expression; displaying it does not necessarily modify state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 3: code

- Make available: `boto3`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `os`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `dotenv`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `time`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 4: code

- Store expression result in `region`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `bedrock`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `bedrock_runtime`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- `load_dotenv`: Load configuration into the process; use the explicit repository .environment/.env path in your practice copy.
- `os.getenv`: Read a named environment setting; check presence rather than printing its value.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 5: code

- Store expression result in `response`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `models`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Visit each item in a loop. Track what is added or changed on each iteration; an async loop awaits incoming items.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 6: Amazon Bedrock Cross-Region Inference

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 7: code

- Store list in `QUESTION`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store list in `messages`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `system_prompt`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Define `run_conversation(questions, model_id, system_prompt, sleep_time)`. Its body runs when called.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `messages.append`: Add one item to an existing list; rerunning the cell repeats that addition.
- `sleep`: Pause. asyncio.sleep yields the loop; time.sleep blocks the current thread.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 8: code

- Inspect the evaluated value or expression; displaying it does not necessarily modify state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

## Definitions to find

| Cell | Name | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | `run_conversation` | function |

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
