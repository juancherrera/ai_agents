# 1 lab1 OPENROUTER

Source: [1_foundations/community_contributions/rodrigo/1_lab1_OPENROUTER.ipynb](../../../../../../../1_foundations/community_contributions/rodrigo/1_lab1_OPENROUTER.ipynb). Practice: [commented notebook](practice.ipynb).

Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → Messages → Client, request, and response are separate objects → Request, status, and parsed body

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Messages: instructions, earlier turns, and the new question

The model request is a list of messages. A role says who is speaking; content holds the text. The system instruction and prior conversation serve different purposes.

**Ask yourself:** How many messages are sent on the follow-up turn?

**Practice:** Set history to an empty list. Explain what is lost while the system instruction remains.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### Request, status, and parsed body

An HTTP client sends a request and returns a status plus response body. Provider requests are network side effects; a fixture lets you practice handling success/failure without sending one.

**Ask yourself:** Will a non-200 response be treated as success here?

**Practice:** Add a 429 fixture and distinguish rate limiting from authentication. Explain why real calls need timeouts.

## Follow the source in order

### Cell 1: code

- Make available: `dotenv`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 2: code

- `load_dotenv`: Load configuration into the process; use the explicit repository .environment/.env path in your practice copy.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 3: code

- Make available: `os`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Store expression result in `openRouter_api_key`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Choose a branch using a condition. Predict both the true and false paths before running the source.
- `os.getenv`: Read a named environment setting; check presence rather than printing its value.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 4: code

- Make available: `requests`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Store expression result in `MODEL`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 5: code

- Store list in `chatHistory`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 6: code

- Define `chatWithOpenRouter(prompt)`. Its body runs when called.
- `chatHistory.append`: Add one item to an existing list; rerunning the cell repeats that addition.
- `requests.post`: Send an HTTP POST. Notification/email calls have external effects.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 7: code

- Store expression result in `messages`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 8: code

- Store expression result in `response`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 9: code

- Store expression result in `question`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 10: code

- Store expression result in `response`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 11: code

- Store expression result in `message`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `answer`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 12: Congratulations!

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 17: code

Empty code cell; it defines no state.

## Definitions to find

| Cell | Name | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | `chatWithOpenRouter` | function |

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
