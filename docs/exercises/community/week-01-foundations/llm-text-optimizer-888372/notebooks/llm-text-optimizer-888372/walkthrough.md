# llm text optimizer

Source: [1_foundations/community_contributions/llm-text-optimizer.ipynb](../../../../../../../1_foundations/community_contributions/llm-text-optimizer.ipynb). Practice: [commented notebook](practice.ipynb).

Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → Provider endpoint and model selection → Messages → Client, request, and response are separate objects → Evaluate, give feedback, and bound revision → Retrieve evidence before answering

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Provider endpoint and model selection

A compatible client can target different services. The endpoint selects the provider and its credentials; the model identifier selects a model there. Compatibility does not guarantee every feature works.

**Ask yourself:** Does changing only the variable name change the provider?

**Practice:** Add a provider from the linked source. Copy its endpoint and variable name, never a credential value.

### Messages: instructions, earlier turns, and the new question

The model request is a list of messages. A role says who is speaking; content holds the text. The system instruction and prior conversation serve different purposes.

**Ask yourself:** How many messages are sent on the follow-up turn?

**Practice:** Set history to an empty list. Explain what is lost while the system instruction remains.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### Evaluate, give feedback, and bound revision

A worker produces a draft and an evaluator judges it against criteria. Feedback becomes input for another attempt. The evaluator here is a small deterministic teaching rule, not a general quality checker.

**Ask yourself:** Is the first draft acceptable? How many attempts will be allowed?

**Practice:** Make the second draft fail too. Add an explicit message when the finite retry limit is reached.

### Retrieve evidence before answering

A retrieval workflow selects relevant chunks and passes them as context. This tiny keyword example illustrates the boundary without embeddings, a vector store, or a hosted model.

**Ask yourself:** Which chunk matches the query about Python?

**Practice:** Try a query with no matches. Return an explicit lack-of-evidence result instead of inventing an answer.

## Follow the source in order

### Cell 1: Explanation, context, or transition

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 2: code

- Make available: `os`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `json`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `dotenv`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `openai`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `IPython.display`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 3: Explanation, context, or transition

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 4: code

- Store expression result in `open_api_key`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- Store expression result in `groq_api_key`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.
- `load_dotenv`: Load configuration into the process; use the explicit repository .environment/.env path in your practice copy.
- `os.getenv`: Read a named environment setting; check presence rather than printing its value.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 5: Explanation, context, or transition

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 6: code

- Make available: `openai`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Define `api_key_checker(api_key)`. Its body runs when called.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.

### Cell 7: Helper Functions

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 8: code

- Define `generate_llm_response(provider, system_msg, user_msg, temperature)`. Its body runs when called.
- Define `llm_optimizer(provider, prompt, feedback)`. Its body runs when called.
- Define `llm_evaluator(provider, prompt, response)`. Its body runs when called.
- Define `optimize_prompt_runner(prompt, provider, max_iterations)`. Its body runs when called.
- `client.chat.completions.create`: Create an object or request, depending on the receiver. For chat.completions.create, this is the provider call.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `OpenAI`: Construct a compatible model client. Construction is separate from a request.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
