Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → Messages → Client, request, and response are separate objects → A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes → An agent loop must make progress and stop → Drafting and delivering are separate steps → A callback receives a message and history → Extracted documents become prompt context → Request, status, and parsed body

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Messages: instructions, earlier turns, and the new question

The model request is a list of messages. A role says who is speaking; content holds the text. The system instruction and prior conversation serve different purposes.

**Ask yourself:** How many messages are sent on the follow-up turn?

**Practice:** Set history to an empty list. Explain what is lost while the system instruction remains.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### An agent loop must make progress and stop

A loop repeats model/tool steps until a final answer or a configured limit. This fixed script of decisions shows the order without executing generated code or calling a model.

**Ask yourself:** Which decision ends the loop?

**Practice:** Add another tool step before the answer. Keep a finite turn limit and explain how the stopping rule changes.

### Drafting and delivering are separate steps

An agent that formats text is different from a tool that sends email or notifications. This exercise records a delivery intention in memory only.

**Ask yourself:** Will constructing this draft contact anyone?

**Practice:** Format the body as HTML but keep dry_run_send unchanged. Explain where real delivery would begin.

### A callback receives a message and history

A UI invokes your function and displays its return value. Earlier turns are an input, not automatic model memory. This practice calls the callback directly without starting a server.

**Ask yourself:** What changes when history contains two old messages?

**Practice:** Make the callback return an uppercase version of the question. Compare returning a value with printing it.

### Extracted documents become prompt context

The source reads document text and places it in a prompt. This is context injection, not permanent training. A missing page extract must not break concatenation.

**Ask yourself:** Does a page with None add text?

**Practice:** Add a fictional skill and rebuild the prompt. Explain why the existing string does not update itself.

### Request, status, and parsed body

An HTTP client sends a request and returns a status plus response body. Provider requests are network side effects; a fixture lets you practice handling success/failure without sending one.

**Ask yourself:** Will a non-200 response be treated as success here?

**Practice:** Add a 429 fixture and distinguish rate limiting from authentication. Explain why real calls need timeouts.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
