Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → Messages → Client, request, and response are separate objects → Extracted documents become prompt context

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Messages: instructions, earlier turns, and the new question

The model request is a list of messages. A role says who is speaking; content holds the text. The system instruction and prior conversation serve different purposes.

**Ask yourself:** How many messages are sent on the follow-up turn?

**Practice:** Set history to an empty list. Explain what is lost while the system instruction remains.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### Extracted documents become prompt context

The source reads document text and places it in a prompt. This is context injection, not permanent training. A missing page extract must not break concatenation.

**Ask yourself:** Does a page with None add text?

**Practice:** Add a fictional skill and rebuild the prompt. Explain why the existing string does not update itself.

### Cell 5: code

- Make available: `dotenv`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
