Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → Provider endpoint and model selection → Configure a real SDK agent and inspect its tool schema → Client, request, and response are separate objects → A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes → Await vs. concurrent work → Structured output validates shape → Plan → search → synthesize → Drafting and delivering are separate steps → Request, status, and parsed body

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Provider endpoint and model selection

A compatible client can target different services. The endpoint selects the provider and its credentials; the model identifier selects a model there. Compatibility does not guarantee every feature works.

**Ask yourself:** Does changing only the variable name change the provider?

**Practice:** Add a provider from the linked source. Copy its endpoint and variable name, never a credential value.

### Configure a real SDK agent and inspect its tool schema

Agent holds instructions/model/tools. The function_tool decorator constructs a schema from the signature and docstring. Constructing this configuration does not run the agent or contact a provider.

**Ask yourself:** Which argument names will appear in the registered tool schema?

**Practice:** Change the docstring and inspect the tool description. Find Runner.run in the source: that is where the interaction loop actually begins.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### Structured output validates shape

Pydantic models name the fields you expect and check constraints. This helps callers use results reliably, but a valid field can still contain a false claim.

**Ask yourself:** Will confidence=2 pass the constraint?

**Practice:** Add a field named follow_up_questions with type list[str]. Construct a valid object using it.

### Plan → search → synthesize

The research workflow separates a search plan, collected findings, and a report. Use fixed fictional snippets first so you can inspect how evidence reaches the writer. No current facts are being researched here.

**Ask yourself:** Will the report receive the original query as well as the findings?

**Practice:** Add a third search plan item and a matching fixture. Explain how the original query keeps synthesis focused.

### Drafting and delivering are separate steps

An agent that formats text is different from a tool that sends email or notifications. This exercise records a delivery intention in memory only.

**Ask yourself:** Will constructing this draft contact anyone?

**Practice:** Format the body as HTML but keep dry_run_send unchanged. Explain where real delivery would begin.

### Request, status, and parsed body

An HTTP client sends a request and returns a status plus response body. Provider requests are network side effects; a fixture lets you practice handling success/failure without sending one.

**Ask yourself:** Will a non-200 response be treated as success here?

**Practice:** Add a 429 fixture and distinguish rate limiting from authentication. Explain why real calls need timeouts.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
