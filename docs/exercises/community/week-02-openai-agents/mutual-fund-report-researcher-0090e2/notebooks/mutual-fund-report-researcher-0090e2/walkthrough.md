**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### Provider endpoint and model selection

A compatible client can target different services. The endpoint selects the provider and its credentials; the model identifier selects a model there. Compatibility does not guarantee every feature works.

**Ask yourself:** Does changing only the variable name change the provider?

**Practice:** Add a provider from the linked source. Copy its endpoint and variable name, never a credential value.

### Configure a real SDK agent and inspect its tool schema

Agent holds instructions/model/tools. The function_tool decorator constructs a schema from the signature and docstring. Constructing this configuration does not run the agent or contact a provider.

**Ask yourself:** Which argument names will appear in the registered tool schema?

**Practice:** Change the docstring and inspect the tool description. Find Runner.run in the source: that is where the interaction loop actually begins.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### Structured output validates shape

Pydantic models name the fields you expect and check constraints. This helps callers use results reliably, but a valid field can still contain a false claim.

**Ask yourself:** Will confidence=2 pass the constraint?

**Practice:** Add a field named follow_up_questions with type list[str]. Construct a valid object using it.

### A guardrail makes a stop/continue decision

An input guardrail checks a request before later work. The tripwire is a boolean. This deterministic example teaches the branch; it is not the model-based name detector in the source.

**Ask yourself:** Does Alice trigger this demonstration guardrail?

**Practice:** Try another name and observe the limitation. Describe how you would evaluate false positives and missed names.

### Agent as a tool vs. handoff

A tool returns its result to the calling agent. A handoff transfers control to the receiving agent. This trace uses ordinary Python to make that distinction visible.

**Ask yourself:** After the tool finishes, who produces the next step?

**Practice:** Sketch which pattern fits a writer consulting a researcher, and which fits routing a customer to support.

### Drafting and delivering are separate steps

An agent that formats text is different from a tool that sends email or notifications. This exercise records a delivery intention in memory only.

**Ask yourself:** Will constructing this draft contact anyone?

**Practice:** Format the body as HTML but keep dry_run_send unchanged. Explain where real delivery would begin.

### A callback receives a message and history

A UI invokes your function and displays its return value. Earlier turns are an input, not automatic model memory. This practice calls the callback directly without starting a server.

**Ask yourself:** What changes when history contains two old messages?

**Practice:** Make the callback return an uppercase version of the question. Compare returning a value with printing it.

### Configuration fills named placeholders

The crew entry point supplies inputs, and YAML descriptions contain placeholders. Configuration names must match the inputs used at runtime.

**Ask yourself:** What happens if motion is not supplied?

**Practice:** Add a second placeholder named audience and provide its value. Identify matching input keys in the linked source main.py.

- Keep a resource open for the block, then clean it up. Server/tool calls must remain inside the connection lifetime.
- `load_dotenv`: Load configuration into the process; use the explicit repository .environment/.env path in your practice copy.
- `Agent`: Define an agent configuration: responsibilities, model, and available tools.
- `Mf_list.as_tool`: Make an agent callable as a tool; the caller receives the subagent result.
- `ui.launch`: Start the UI/server; defining the UI alone does not start it.
- `Field`: Describe a schema field or constrain allowed values.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `Mail(...).get`: Retrieve a value or HTTP resource, depending on the receiver.
- `sg.client.mail.send.post`: Send an HTTP POST. Notification/email calls have external effects.
- `trace`: Group activity for inspection. Configured tracing may export run data.
- `Runner.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.
- `os.environ.get`: Retrieve a value or HTTP resource, depending on the receiver.
- `enumerate`: Produce indices with values. Check whether the starting index is zero or one.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
