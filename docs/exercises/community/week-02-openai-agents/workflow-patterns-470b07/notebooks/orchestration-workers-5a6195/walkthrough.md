Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configure a real SDK agent and inspect its tool schema → Client, request, and response are separate objects → An agent loop must make progress and stop → Await vs. concurrent work → A guardrail makes a stop/continue decision → Plan → search → synthesize → A callback receives a message and history → A recurring engine is different from a UI

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configure a real SDK agent and inspect its tool schema

Agent holds instructions/model/tools. The function_tool decorator constructs a schema from the signature and docstring. Constructing this configuration does not run the agent or contact a provider.

**Ask yourself:** Which argument names will appear in the registered tool schema?

**Practice:** Change the docstring and inspect the tool description. Find Runner.run in the source: that is where the interaction loop actually begins.

### Client, request, and response are separate objects

Constructing a client prepares a connection interface. A request invokes it. The returned response contains choices, a message, and its content. This fixture imitates that nested shape.

**Ask yourself:** What does choices[0] select?

**Practice:** Add a second choice with different text. Read choices[1] and explain why choosing an index matters.

### An agent loop must make progress and stop

A loop repeats model/tool steps until a final answer or a configured limit. This fixed script of decisions shows the order without executing generated code or calling a model.

**Ask yourself:** Which decision ends the loop?

**Practice:** Add another tool step before the answer. Keep a finite turn limit and explain how the stopping rule changes.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### A guardrail makes a stop/continue decision

An input guardrail checks a request before later work. The tripwire is a boolean. This deterministic example teaches the branch; it is not the model-based name detector in the source.

**Ask yourself:** Does Alice trigger this demonstration guardrail?

**Practice:** Try another name and observe the limitation. Describe how you would evaluate false positives and missed names.

### Plan → search → synthesize

The research workflow separates a search plan, collected findings, and a report. Use fixed fictional snippets first so you can inspect how evidence reaches the writer. No current facts are being researched here.

**Ask yourself:** Will the report receive the original query as well as the findings?

**Practice:** Add a third search plan item and a matching fixture. Explain how the original query keeps synthesis focused.

### A callback receives a message and history

A UI invokes your function and displays its return value. Earlier turns are an input, not automatic model memory. This practice calls the callback directly without starting a server.

**Ask yourself:** What changes when history contains two old messages?

**Practice:** Make the callback return an uppercase version of the question. Compare returning a value with printing it.

### A recurring engine is different from a UI

The UI displays state. An engine repeatedly invokes workers. A finite practice loop makes the scheduling visible without leaving a background job running.

**Ask yourself:** How many worker invocations happen with two rounds and four traders?

**Practice:** Add a market-open boolean that skips a round. Explain why the source while True needs an intentional stop method.

## Follow the source in order

### Cell 1: code

- Inspect the evaluated value or expression; displaying it does not necessarily modify state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 2: Explanation, context, or transition

Read this before the next code cell. If it contains an assignment, restate the expected result before writing code. External pages linked here have not been extracted.

### Cell 3: code

- Make available: `asyncio`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `typing`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `gradio`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `agents`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `build_agents`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `rich.console`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.
- Make available: `rich.markdown`. Imports do not by themselves perform the later model request, although imported modules can have initialization side effects.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 4: code

- Store expression result in `console`. Re-executing this cell updates kernel state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 5: code

- Define class `ResearchManager`. Separate the class definition, constructing an instance, and calling its methods.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `trace`: Group activity for inspection. Configured tracing may export run data.
- `Runner.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.
- `asyncio.create_task`: Schedule a coroutine as a task so it can run alongside others.
- `asyncio.gather`: Schedule independent coroutines; returned results follow input order.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 6: code

- Define `main()`. Its body runs when called; await/schedule the coroutine to execute async work.
- `print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `console.print`: Show diagnostic output; this does not replace returning a callback result.
- `manager.run`: Run the receiver workflow. Runner.run can make multiple model/tool calls; server.run can start a listener.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

### Cell 7: code

- Inspect the evaluated value or expression; displaying it does not necessarily modify state.

**Pause:** which values does this cell require from earlier cells, and what value or side effect does it produce? Run the offline adaptation before the source.

## Definitions to find

| Cell | Name | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | `ResearchManager` | class |
| 5 | `run` | async function |
| 5 | `_topic_check` | async function |
| 5 | `_plan_searches` | async function |
| 5 | `_perform_searches` | async function |
| 5 | `_search` | async function |
| 5 | `_write_report` | async function |
| 6 | `main` | async function |

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
