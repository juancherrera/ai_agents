Cell positions below count all cells, including Markdown. They are not execution counts. The map was extracted from local source cells, never their saved outputs.

## Follow the flow

Configuration stays outside executable examples → A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes → Await vs. concurrent work → Structured output validates shape → Evaluate, give feedback, and bound revision → Plan → search → synthesize → Drafting and delivering are separate steps

**Before source execution:** This community variant is mapped from its local source. Feature labels describe visible code vocabulary, not a verified execution trace. Read its README/entry point before running the original; external dependencies, models, and side effects are unverified.

Study one concept per sitting. Predict a value, run the corresponding practice cell, explain it, then change one input. If state becomes confusing, restart the practice kernel and run from the top.

## Concepts to understand

### Configuration stays outside executable examples

Environment-variable names identify settings. Values belong in .environment/.env and are loaded deliberately. This exercise inspects only the path and simulated presence flags; it reads no private file or variable values.

**Ask yourself:** Does finding a file prove that authentication works?

**Practice:** Explain the difference between a missing file, a missing variable, and a provider rejecting authentication. Do not print token prefixes or values.

### A tool schema describes; a dispatcher executes

The model can request a function call. Your application decodes arguments, recognizes the name, executes the function, and returns a matching tool result. No model is needed to practice this boundary.

**Ask yourself:** Does defining the schema call the function?

**Practice:** Change the requested name to an unknown function and observe the error. Then add a harmless second tool to the registry.

### Await vs. concurrent work

Calling an async function creates a coroutine. Await executes/waits for it. gather schedules independent coroutines and returns results in input order. Notebook cells support top-level await.

**Ask yourself:** Will results follow completion order or input order?

**Practice:** Run the two functions with separate awaits. Explain why a dependent stage cannot start until it has its input.

### Structured output validates shape

Pydantic models name the fields you expect and check constraints. This helps callers use results reliably, but a valid field can still contain a false claim.

**Ask yourself:** Will confidence=2 pass the constraint?

**Practice:** Add a field named follow_up_questions with type list[str]. Construct a valid object using it.

### Evaluate, give feedback, and bound revision

A worker produces a draft and an evaluator judges it against criteria. Feedback becomes input for another attempt. The evaluator here is a small deterministic teaching rule, not a general quality checker.

**Ask yourself:** Is the first draft acceptable? How many attempts will be allowed?

**Practice:** Make the second draft fail too. Add an explicit message when the finite retry limit is reached.

### Plan → search → synthesize

The research workflow separates a search plan, collected findings, and a report. Use fixed fictional snippets first so you can inspect how evidence reaches the writer. No current facts are being researched here.

**Ask yourself:** Will the report receive the original query as well as the findings?

**Practice:** Add a third search plan item and a matching fixture. Explain how the original query keeps synthesis focused.

### Drafting and delivering are separate steps

An agent that formats text is different from a tool that sends email or notifications. This exercise records a delivery intention in memory only.

**Ask yourself:** Will constructing this draft contact anyone?

**Practice:** Format the body as HTML but keep dry_run_send unchanged. Explain where real delivery would begin.

## Finish check

Explain the inputs, state changes, and stopping rule in your own words. Identify where model calls and external actions begin. A passing practice fixture does not prove the original hosted workflow works.
